# GridLead: Solo Creator Outreach Engine

GridLead is a high-fidelity workspace designed for solo web developers and small agencies to automate the "un-fun" parts of business development. It bridges the gap between cold lead discovery and closed deals.

## Core Philosophy
- **Minimalist Friction**: Every click between finding a lead and sending an email is a point of failure. GridLead minimizes this path.
- **High Intent**: We don't just find businesses; we find businesses with *deficits* (slow speed, poor design, missing SSL).
- **Personalized Scale**: Using Gemini-3-flash to generate custom hooks that don't sound like generic cold outreach.

## The Workflow
1. **Discovery**: Search local niches + radius.
2. **Review**: Audit the lead's digital health (Scores: Design, Speed, Market, Trust).
3. **Outreach**: AI-assisted draft generation and thread initiation.
4. **Stats**: Track your pipeline value and conversion goals.
